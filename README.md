### _My Portfolio_

## Task

Build a progressive web-app that manages students and lecturers from a university's department. It involves building the frontend and backend separately and connecting them. You are welcome to use any technology to build it and design the layout in any way that you see fit.

## Criteria

- Choice of design, layout and intuitiveness of interface
- Responsiveness across various form factors
- Page load times and performance
- Browser compatibility on current release, current release-1 versions of browsers
- Sorting and or filter options available to user
- Use of source control to store code

## Summary of Tech Stack

This app was built using the latest and greatest technologies out today. I chose to build it in React becuase of **React's** flexible architecture for building component based applications. I chose to use **Redux** as my single state handler becasue of its overall clean and effective way of handling the state of the application especially for scaling it larger. I chose **Webpack** beause well, I love using it. It takes away the layer that other task runners like Gulp and Grunt add to projects. I chose **NodeJs** to build out the server because of it's robust and easy to implement architecture with I would proceed to deploy on **Digital Ocean** . I went with a simple **EspressJs** server.

## Functionality

This app manages all the Students and staff from a university's department. From there I created a search option at the top which gives users the ability to search through the various sectons of the application with ease. I also created a dashboard system, custom to the type of logged in user or role.

## Design

I went with simplicity and accessibility,this because I love the simplicity and achieving more by doing less on the part of the end users. Interaction with the app is friendly and problems or errors are communicated effectly.
