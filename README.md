### _My Portfolio_

## Task

Build a vuejs web-app with NuxtJS that showcases my portfolio, skills, experiences and a quick and easy way to reach out to me.
## Criteria

- Choice of design, layout and intuitiveness of interface
- Responsiveness across various form factors
- Page load times and performance
- Browser compatibility on current release, current release-1 versions of browsers
- Sorting and or filter options available to user
- Use of source control to store code

## Summary of Tech Stack

This app was built using the latest and greatest technologies out today. I chose to build it in Vue becuase of **Vue's** flexible architecture for building component based applications with **NUxtJS**. I chose to use **Sass** as my css preprocessor using the scss extension because I love **Sass**.

## Functionality

This app manages all the Students and staff from a university's department. From there I created a search option at the top which gives users the ability to search through the various sectons of the application with ease. I also created a dashboard system, custom to the type of logged in user or role.

## Design

I went with simplicity and accessibility,this because I love the simplicity and achieving more by doing less on the part of the end users. Interaction with the app is friendly and problems or errors are communicated effectly.
