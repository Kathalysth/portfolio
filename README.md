### _My Portfolio_


Built a Vuejs web-app with NuxtJS that showcases my portfolio, skills, experiences and a quick and easy way to reach out to me.


## Summary of Tech Stack

This app was built using the latest and greatest technologies out today. I chose to build it in Vue becuase of **Vue's** flexible architecture for building component based applications with **NuxtJS**. I chose to use **Sass** as my css preprocessor using the scss extension because I love **Sass**.

## Design

I went with simplicity and accessibility,this because I love the simplicity and achieving more by doing less on the part of the end users. Interaction with the app is friendly and problems or errors are communicated effectly.

## Run Locally
